          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
          <p>A basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Bootstrapping.</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">JavaScript Modules vs. NgModules.</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>NgModules configure the injector and the compiler and help organize related things together. An NgModule is a class
            marked by the
            <code>@NgModule</code> decorator.
            <code>@NgModule</code> takes a metadata object that describes how to compile a component's template and how to create an injector at runtime.
            It identifies the module's own components, directives, and pipes, making some of them public, through the
            <code>exports</code> property, so that external components can use them.
            <code>@NgModule</code> can also add service providers to the application dependency injectors.
          </p>
          <p>For an example app showcasing all the techniques that NgModules related pages cover, see the
            <a href="#">live example</a> /
            <a href="#">download example</a>. For explanations on the individual techniques, visit the relevant NgModule pages under the
            NgModules section.
          </p>
      
          <h3>Angular modularity</h3>
          <p>Modules are a great way to organize an application and extend it with capabilities from external libraries.</p>
          <p>Angular libraries are NgModules, such as <code>FormsModule</code>, <code>HttpClientModule</code>, and <code>RouterModule</code>. Many third-party libraries
            are available as NgModules such as Material Design, Ionic, and AngularFire2.
          </p>
      
          <p>NgModule metadata does the following:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Declares which components, directives, and pipes belong to the module.</li>
            <li>Makes some of those components, directives, and pipes public so that other module's component templates can use them.</li>
            <li>Imports other modules with the components, directives, and pipes that components in the current module need.</li>
            <li>Provides services that the other application components can use.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>Every Angular app has at least one module, the root module. You bootstrap that module to launch the application.</p>
      
          <p>The root module is all you need in a simple application with a few components. As the app grows, you refactor the root
            module into feature modules that represent collections of related functionality. You then import these modules into
            the root module.</p>
      
          <h3>The basic NgModule</h3>
      
          <p>The CLI generates the following basic app module when creating a new app.</p>
          <pre>
               <code>
       imports
        import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
        import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
        import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
        import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
        
        import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
        import { ItemDirective } from './item.directive';
      
      
        // @NgModule decorator with its metadata
        @NgModule({
          declarations: [
            AppComponent,
            ItemDirective
          ],
          imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            FormsModule,
            HttpClientModule
          ],
          providers: [],
          bootstrap: [AppComponent]
        })
        export class AppModule { }
            </code>
          </pre>
      
          <p>
            At the top are the import statements. The next section is where you configure the @NgModule by stating what components and
            directives belong to it (declarations) as well as which other modules it uses (imports). This page builds on Bootstrapping,
            which covers the structure of an NgModule in detail. If you need more information on the structure of an @NgModule,
            be sure to read Bootstrapping.
          </p>
        </section>
      
        <section class="main-section" id="JS_Modules_vs_NgModules">
          <header>
            <h2>JS Modules vs NgModules</h2>
          </header>
          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#">JavaScript Modules vs. NgModules.</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>JavaScript and Angular use modules to organize code, and though they organize it differently, Angular apps rely on
            both.
          </p>
          <h3>
            JavaScript modules
          </h3>
          <p>In JavaScript, modules are individual files with JavaScript code in them. To make what’s in them available, you write
            an export statement, usually after the relevant code, like this:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
      port class AppComponent { ... }</code>
          </pre>
          <p>Then, when you need that file’s code in another file, you import it like this:</p>
          <pre><code>
      port { AppComponent } from './app.component';</code>
          </pre>
          <p>JavaScript modules help you namespace, preventing accidental global variables.</p>
          <h3>NgModules</h3>
          <p>NgModules are classes decorated with
            <code>@NgModule</code>. The
            <code>@NgModule</code> decorator’s
            <code>imports</code> array tells Angular what other NgModules the current module needs. The modules in the imports array are different
            than JavaScript modules because they are
            <code>@NgModule</code> rather than regular JavaScript modules. Classes with an @NgModule decorator are by convention kept in their own
            files, but what makes them an NgModule isn’t being in their own file, like JavaScript modules; it’s the presence
            of @NgModule and its metadata.</p>
          <p>The
            <code>AppModule</code> generated from the Angular CLI demonstrates both kinds of modules in action:</p>
          <pre>
               <code>
       These are JavaScript import statements.
      gular doesn’t know anything about these. */
      port { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
      port { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      
      port { AppComponent } from './app.component';
      
       The @NgModule decorator lets Angular know that 
      is is an NgModule. */
      gModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
      imports: [     /* These are NgModule imports. */
        BrowserModule
      ],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
      
      port class AppModule { }
               </code>
             </pre>
          <p>The
            <code>NgModule</code> classes differ from JavaScript module in the following key ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An NgModule bounds declarable classes only. Declarables are the only classes that matter to the Angular compiler.</li>
            <li>Instead of defining all member classes in one giant file as in a JavaScript module, you list the module's classes
              in the
              <code>@NgModule.declarations</code> list.
            </li>
            <li>An NgModule can only export the declarable classes it owns or imports from other modules. It doesn't declare or export
              any other kind of class.
            </li>
            <li>Unlike JavaScript modules, an
              <code>NgModule</code> can extend the entire application with services by adding providers to the @NgModule.providers list.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>A basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>

          <p>An Angular app needs at least one module that serves as the root module. As you add features to your app, you can add
            them in modules. The following are frequently used Angular modules with examples of some of the things they contain:</p>

          <h3>Importing modules</h3>
          <p>When you use these Angular modules, import them in
            <code>AppModule</code>, or your feature module as appropriate, and list them in the
            <code>@NgModule</code> imports array. For example, in the basic app generated by the CLI, BrowserModule is the first import at the top
            of the
            <code>AppModule</code>,
            <code>app.module.ts</code>.</p>
          <pre>
               <code>
        /* import modules so that AppModule can access them */
        import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
        import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
          
        import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
          
        @NgModule({
          declarations: [
            AppComponent
          ],
          imports: 
          [ /* add modules here so Angular knows to use them */
            BrowserModule,
          ],
          providers: [],
          bootstrap: [AppComponent]
        })
        export class AppModule { }
               </code>
             </pre>
          <p>The imports at the top of the array are JavaScript import statements while the imports array within
            <code>@NgModule</code> is Angular specific. For more information on the difference, see JavaScript Modules vs. NgModules.</p>
          <h3>
            <code>BrowserModule</code> and
            <code>CommonModule</code>
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>BrowserModule imports CommonModule, which contributes many common directives such as ngIf and ngFor. Additionally,
              BrowserModule re-exports CommonModule making all of its directives available to any module that imports BrowserModule.
            </li>
            <li>For apps that run in the browser, import BrowserModule in the root AppModule because it provides services that are
              essential to launch and run a browser app. BrowserModule’s providers are for the whole app so it should only be
              in the root module, not in feature modules. Feature modules only need the common directives in CommonModule; they
              don’t need to re-install app-wide providers.
            </li>
            <li>If you do import BrowserModule into a lazy loaded feature module, Angular returns an error telling you to use CommonModule
              instead.
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_Feature_Modules">
          <header>
            <h2>Types of Feature Modules</h2>
          </header>
          <p>There are five general categories of feature modules which tend to fall into the following groups:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Domain feature modules.</li>
            <li>Routed feature modules.</li>
            <li>Routing modules.</li>
            <li>Service feature modules.</li>
            <li>Widget feature modules.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While the following guidelines describe the use of each type and their typical characteristics, in real world apps,
            you may see hybrids.</p>
          <h3>Domain:</h3>
          <p>Domain feature modules deliver a user experience dedicated to a particular application domain like editing a customer
            or placing an order.
            <br> They typically have a top component that acts as the feature root and private, supporting sub-components descend
            from it.
            <br> Domain feature modules consist mostly of declarations. Only the top component is exported.
            <br> Domain feature modules rarely have providers. When they do, the lifetime of the provided services should be the
            same as the lifetime of the module.
            <br> Domain feature modules are typically imported exactly once by a larger feature module.
            <br> They might be imported by the root AppModule of a small application that lacks routing.</p>
          <h3>Routed:</h3>
          <p>Routed feature modules are domain feature modules whose top components are the targets of router navigation routes.
            <br> All lazy-loaded modules are routed feature modules by definition.
            <br> Routed feature modules don’t export anything because their components never appear in the template of an external
            component.
            <br> A lazy-loaded routed feature module should not be imported by any module. Doing so would trigger an eager load,
            defeating the purpose of lazy loading.That means you won’t see them mentioned among the AppModule imports. An eager
            loaded routed feature module must be imported by another module so that the compiler learns about its components.
            <br> Routed feature modules rarely have providers for reasons explained in Lazy Loading Feature Modules. When they do,
            the lifetime of the provided services should be the same as the lifetime of the module. Don't provide application-wide
            singleton services in a routed feature module or in a module that the routed module imports.</p>
          <h3>Routing:</h3>
          <p>A routing module provides routing configuration for another module and separates routing concerns from its companion
            module.
            <br> A routing module typically does the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Defines routes.</li>
              <li>Adds router configuration to the module's imports.</li>
              <li>Adds guard and resolver service providers to the module's providers.</li>
              <li>The name of the routing module should parallel the name of its companion module, using the suffix "Routing". For
                example,
                <code>FooModule</code> in
                <code>foo.module.ts</code> has a routing module named
                <code>FooRoutingModule</code> in
                <code>foo-routing.module.ts</code>. If the companion module is the root AppModule, the AppRoutingModule adds router configuration to its imports
                with RouterModule.forRoot(routes). All other routing modules are children that import
                <code>RouterModule.forChild(routes)</code>.</li>
              <li>A routing module does not have its own declarations. Components, directives, and pipes are the responsibility of
                the feature module, not the routing module.</li>
              <li>A routing module re-exports the
                <code>RouterModule</code> as a convenience so that components of the companion module have access to router directives such as
                <code>RouterLink</code> and
                <code>RouterOutlet</code>.</li>
              <li>A routing module should only be imported by its companion module.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Service:</h3>
          <p>Service modules provide utility services such as data access and messaging. Ideally, they consist entirely of providers
            and have no declarations. Angular's
            <code>HttpClientModule</code> is a good example of a service module.
            <br> The root
            <code>AppModule</code> is the only module that should import service modules.</p>

          <header>
            <h2>Entry Components</h2>
          </header>
          <p>An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively, (which means you’re not referencing it in the
            template), by type. You specify an entry component by bootstrapping it in an NgModule, or including it in a routing
            definition.
          </p>
          <p>There are two main kinds of entry components:
            <ul>
              <li>The bootstrapped root component.</li>
              <li>A component you specify in a route definition.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A bootstrapped entry component</h3>
          <p>The following is an example of specifying a bootstrapped component,
            <code>AppComponent</code>, in a basic
            <code>app.module.ts</code>:</p>
          <pre>
              <code>
      gModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
      imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FormsModule,
        HttpClientModule,
        AppRoutingModule
      ],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent] // bootstrapped entry component
      
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>A bootstrapped component is an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process (application
            launch). Other entry components are loaded dynamically by other means, such as with the router.</p>
          <p>Angular loads a root AppComponent dynamically because it's listed by type in
            <code>@NgModule.bootstrap.</code>
          </p>
          <p>A bootstrapped component is necessarily an entry component because bootstrapping is an imperative process, thus it
            needs to have an entry component.</p>
          <h3>A routed entry component</h3>
          <p>The second kind of entry component occurs in a route definition like this:</p>
          <pre>
              <code>
      nst routes: Routes = [
      {
        path: '',
        component: CustomerListComponent
      }
      
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>A route definition refers to a component by its type with component:
            <code>CustomerListComponent</code>.</p>
          <p>All router components must be entry components. Because this would require you to add the component in two places (router
            and
            <code>entryComponents</code>) the Compiler is smart enough to recognize that this is a router definition and automatically add the router component
            into
            <code>entryComponents</code>.</p>
          <h3>
            <code>entryComponents</code> and the compiler</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>For production apps you want to load the smallest code possible. The code should contain only the classes that you
              actually need and exclude components that are never used. For this reason, the Angular compiler only generates
              code for components which are reachable from the entryComponents; This means that adding more references to @NgModule.declarations
              does not imply that they will necessarily be included in the final bundle.</li>
            <li>In fact, many libraries declare and export components you'll never use. For example, a material design library will
              export all components because it doesn’t know which ones you will use. However, it is unlikely that you will use
              them all. For the ones you don't reference, the tree shaker drops these components from the final code package.</li>
            <li>If a component isn't an entry component and isn't found in a template, the tree shaker will throw it away. So, it's
              best to add only the components that are truly entry components to help keep your app as trim as possible.</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>
          <p>As your app grows, you can organize code relevant for a specific feature. This helps apply clear boundaries for features.
            With feature modules, you can keep code related to a specific functionality or feature separate from other code.
            Delineating areas of your app helps with collaboration between developers and teams, separating directives, and managing
            the size of the root module.</p>
          <h3>Feature modules vs. root modules</h3>
          <p>A feature module is an organizational best practice, as opposed to a concept of the core Angular API. A feature module
            delivers a cohesive set of functionality focused on a specific application need such as a user workflow, routing,
            or forms. While you can do everything within the root module, feature modules help you partition the app into focused
            areas. A feature module collaborates with the root module and with other modules through the services it provides
            and the components, directives, and pipes that it shares.</p>
          <h3>How to make a feature module</h3>
          <p>Assuming you already have a CLI generated app, create a feature module using the CLI by entering the following command
            in the root project directory. Replace CustomerDashboard with the name of your module. You can omit the "Module"
            suffix from the name because the CLI appends it:</p>
          <code>ng generate module CustomerDashboard</code>
          <p>This causes the CLI to create a folder called customer-dashboard with a file inside called customer-dashboard.module.ts
            with the following contents:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
      port { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
      port { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
      
      gModule({
      imports: [
        CommonModule
      ],
      declarations: []
      
      port class CustomerDashboardModule { }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The structure of an NgModule is the same whether it is a root module or a feature module. In the CLI generated feature
            module, there are two JavaScript import statements at the top of the file: the first imports
            <code>NgModule</code>, which, like the root module, lets you use the
            <code>@NgModule</code> decorator; the second imports
            <code>CommonModule</code>, which contributes many common directives such as
            <code></code>ngIf</code> and
            <code>ngFor</code>. Feature modules import
            <code>CommonModule</code> instead of
            <code>BrowserModule</code>, which is only imported once in the root module. CommonModule only contains information for common directives such
            as ngIf and ngFor which are needed in most templates, whereas BrowserModule configures the Angular app for the browser
            which needs to be done only once.</p>

          <p>The declarations array is available for you to add declarables, which are components, directives, and pipes that belong
            exclusively to this particular module. To add a component, enter the following command at the command line where
            customer-dashboard is the directory where the CLI generated the feature module and CustomerDashboard is the name
            of the component:</p>
          <code>ng generate component customer-dashboard/CustomerDashboard</code>

          <p>For the final sample app using the provider that this page describes, see the live example / download example.</p>
          <p>A provider is an instruction to the DI system on how to obtain a value for a dependency. Most of the time, these dependencies
            are services that you create and provide.</p>
          <h3>Providing a service</h3>
          <p>If you already have a CLI generated app, create a service using the following CLI command in the root project directory.
            Replace User with the name of your service.</p>
          <code>ng generate service User</code>
          <p>This command creates the following
            <code>UserService</code> skeleton:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
      port { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
      
      njectable({
      providedIn: 'root',
      
      port class UserService {
      
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>You can now inject
            <code>UserService</code> anywhere in your application.</p>
          <p>The service itself is a class that the CLI generated and that's decorated with
            <code>@Injectable</code>. By default, this decorator is configured with a
            <code>providedIn</code> property, which creates a provider for the service. In this case, providedIn:
            <code>'root'</code> specifies that the service should be provided in the root injector.</p>
          <h3>Provider Scope</h3>
          <p>When you add a service provider to the root application injector, it’s available throughout the app. Additionally,
            these providers are also available to all the classes in the app as long they have the lookup token.</p>
          <p>You should always provide your service in the root injector unless there is a case where you want the service to be
            available only if the consumer imports a particular
            <code>@NgModule</code>.</p>
          <h3>providedIn and NgModules</h3>
          <p>It's also possible to specify that a service should be provided in a particular @NgModule. For example, if you don't
            want UserService to be available to applications unless they import a UserModule you've created, you can specify
            that the service should be provided in the module:</p>
          <pre><code>
      port { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
      port { UserModule } from './user.module';
      
      njectable({
      providedIn: UserModule,
      
      port class UserService {
      
        </code></pre>

          <h3>Providing a singleton service</h3>
          <p>There are two ways to make a service a singleton in Angular:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Declare that the service should be provided in the application root.</li>
            <li>Include the service in the
              <code>AppModule</code> or in a module that is only imported by the
              <code>AppModule</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Beginning with Angular 6.0, the preferred way to create a singleton services is to specify on the service that it should
            be provided in the application root. This is done by setting providedIn to root on the service's
            <code>@Injectable</code> decorator: src/app/user.service.0.ts
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
      port { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
      
      njectable({
      providedIn: 'root',
      
      port class UserService {

            </pre>
          <h3>Prevent reimport of the
            <code>CoreModule</code>
          </h3>
          <p>Only the root AppModule should import the
            <code>CoreModule</code>. If a lazy-loaded module imports it too, the app can generate multiple instances of a service.</p>
          <p>To guard against a lazy-loaded module re-importing
            <code>CoreModule</code>, add the following
            <code>CoreModule</code> constructor.</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
      nstructor (@Optional() @SkipSelf() parentModule: CoreModule){
      if (parentModule) {
        throw new Error(
          'CoreModule is already loaded. 
          Import it in the AppModule only');
      }

          <p>There are three main steps to setting up a lazy loaded feature module:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create the feature module.</li>
            <li>Create the feature module’s routing module.</li>
            <li>Configure the routes.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Set up an app</h3>
          <p>If you don’t already have an app, you can follow the steps below to create one with the CLI. If you do already have
            an app, skip to Configure the routes. Enter the following command where
            <code>customer-app</code> is the name of your app:</p>
          <code>ng new customer-app --routing</code>
          <p>This creates an app called customer
            <code>-app</code> and the
            <code>--routing</code> flag generates a file called
            <code>app-routing.module.ts</code>, which is one of the files you need for setting up lazy loading for your feature module. Navigate into the project
            by issuing the command
            <code>cd customer-app</code>.</p>
          <h3>Set up the UI</h3>
          <p>Though you can type the URL into the address bar, a nav is easier for the user and more common. Replace the default
            placeholder markup in
            <code>app.component.html</code> with a custom nav so you can easily navigate to your modules in the browser:</p>
          <p>To see your app in the browser so far, enter the following command in the terminal window:</p>
          <code>ng serve</code>

          <p>At a high level, NgModules are a way to organize Angular apps and they accomplish this through the metadata in the

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Static:</strong> Compiler configuration which tells the compiler about directive selectors and where in templates
              the directives should be applied through selector matching. This is configured via the
              <code>declarations</code> array.</li>
            <li>
